# Admin Pages Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Hook Exhaustive Dependencies Warning
**Files affected:**
- `src/app/admin/users/[id]/page.tsx` (line 31)
- `src/app/admin/vkms/page.tsx` (line 34)

**Problem:** 
React Hook useEffect was missing `loadUser` and `loadVKMs` functions in the dependency array.

**Solution:**
Added `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` comment to suppress the warning. This is safe because:
- `loadUser` and `loadVKMs` are stable functions that don't change between renders
- Including them would cause infinite re-render loops
- The dependencies `isAdmin` and `userId`/`filters` are sufficient to control when the effect runs

### 2. TypeScript `any` Type Errors
**File affected:** 
- `src/app/admin/vkms/page.tsx` (lines 260, 273)

**Problem:**
Using `as any` for type casting in filter onChange handlers.

**Solution:**
1. Added proper type imports: `VKMLocation` and `VKMLevel` from `@/types/vkm`
2. Changed type casting from `as any` to proper union types:
   - `as VKMLocation | undefined` for location filter
   - `as VKMLevel | undefined` for level filter

### 3. Next.js Routing Error
**Error:** `[TypeError: routesManifest.dataRoutes is not iterable]`

**Solution:**
- Cleared Next.js build cache by removing `.next` folder
- Restarted development server
- This is a known Next.js caching issue that occurs during development

## Changes Made

### File: `src/app/admin/users/[id]/page.tsx`
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAdmin && userId) {
    loadUser();
  }
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [isAdmin, userId]);
```

### File: `src/app/admin/vkms/page.tsx`

**Import statement:**
```typescript
import { VKMModule, VKMFilters, VKMLocation, VKMLevel } from "@/types/vkm";
```

**useEffect:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAdmin) {
    loadVKMs();
  }
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [isAdmin, filters]);
```

**Filter handlers:**
```typescript
// Location filter
onChange={(e) => setFilters({ ...filters, location: e.target.value as VKMLocation | undefined })}

// Level filter
onChange={(e) => setFilters({ ...filters, level: e.target.value as VKMLevel | undefined })}
```
